- 👋 Hi, I’m @Forest-Dewberry
- 👀 I’m interested in using software for marketing and sales, and specifically MLops. Right now I'm in the NuCamp Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. I have experience doing DevOps with Terraform, Chef, Ansible, Azure CI/CD, PyTest, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently further increasing my skills with front end web development with React and the Bootstrap framework. I also am quite handy with Python, git, and the other basics in any SWE job.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, especially websites.
- 📫 How to reach me - forest.dewberry@gmail.com or on here!
