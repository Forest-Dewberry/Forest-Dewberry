- 👋 Hi, I’m @Forest-Dewberry
- 👀 I’m interested in using software for automating business processes and creating simple web apps. Completed the NuCamp Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. I have experience doing DevOps with Terraform, Chef, Ansible, Azure CI/CD, PyTest, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently further increasing my skills with using AI for business processes. I also am quite handy with Python, git, Powershell, bash and the other basics in any SWE job.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate!
